✨ What is Web4.sbs?

Web4.sbs is Kliq Technologies’ open-source AI coding platform that allows users to generate full-stack web applications from natural language descriptions. Once deployed, users can simply describe what they want, and the AI agent will build and deploy the application automatically, with live previews and incremental updates.

Whether you're a startup, SaaS platform, or internal team, Web4.sbs makes app creation effortless and scalable.

 📋 Deploy Checklist

 ✅ Prerequisites

* Cloudflare Workers Paid Plan (or alternative serverless runtime)
* API keys for AI providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, etc.)

 🔑 Required Secrets

* `AI_API_KEY` – Your chosen AI provider
* `JWT_SECRET` – Session management
* `WEBHOOK_SECRET` – Webhook auth
* `SANDBOX_INSTANCE_TYPE` – Container performance tier
* `ALLOWED_EMAIL` – Access control for the app
* `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` – Custom domain configured in Cloudflare / DNS

🌐 DNS Setup for Custom Domains

* Add a wildcard CNAME pointing `*.yourdomain.com` → `yourdomain.com`
* Ensure proxying is enabled for secure previews

### 🏗️ Sandbox Instance Configuration

| Instance Type | Memory  | CPU       | Disk  | Use Case                  |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | ----- | ------------------------- |
| `dev`         | 256 MiB | 1/16 vCPU | 2 GB  | Testing & development     |
| `standard-1`  | 4 GiB   | 1/2 vCPU  | 8 GB  | Light production apps     |
| `standard-2`  | 8 GiB   | 1 vCPU    | 12 GB | Medium workloads          |
| `standard-3`  | 12 GiB  | 2 vCPU    | 16 GB | Production apps (default) |
| `standard-4`  | 12 GiB  | 4 vCPU    | 20 GB | High-performance apps     |

> **Pro Tip:** Start with `standard-3` for most production apps; upgrade to `standard-4` if needed.

## 🎨 How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Describes App] --> B[AI Agent Analyzes Request]
    B --> C[Blueprint & Plan Generation]
    C --> D[Phase-wise Code Generation]
    D --> E[Live Preview in Container]
    E --> F[User Feedback & Iteration]
    F --> D
    D --> G[Deploy to Infrastructure]
```

Flow Summary:

1. User input → AI analyzes requirements
2. Blueprint & plan generated → code built in phases
3. Live preview → iterative refinement via chat
4. One-click deploy → fully functional web app

---

🔒 Security & Privacy

* Encrypted secrets stored safely
* Sandboxed execution prevents unsafe code from affecting other apps
* Input validation and AI content filtering
* Audit logs track all generation activity
